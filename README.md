# Concrete-Strength-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Completed this project as part of my Data Science and Machine Learning Internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP).
Key highlights:
- Studied and Analyzed the Concrete Strength dataset to applying ML models and present my insights. 
- Performed various Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data and compare the variables.
- Experimented with different Machine Learning algorithms, Linear Regression, Bagging, SVM and K-NN.
- Compared the results to recommend the best Regression model.
